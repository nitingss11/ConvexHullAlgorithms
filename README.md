# ConvexHullAlgorithms

Implementation of the following algorithms for constructing the convex hull: 

## 1. Gift wrapping algorithm

## 2. Graham scan algorithm

## 3. Quickhull

## Chart1 - Comparison chart between the algorithms.

5 test cases taken with number of points as (n = )100, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000

## Chart2 - Comparison chart having 3 test cases with varying number of points on the hull. One of those is equal to the number of points (20 in this case)
